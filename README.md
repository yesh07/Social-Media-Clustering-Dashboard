# Social-Media-Clustering-Dashboard

The Clustering with Social Media Data with Dash project showcases expertise in data visualization, clustering, and web development using Python. This project focuses on building an interactive dashboard to cluster and analyze social media data using the Dash framework. The primary goal is to provide a powerful tool for understanding social media trends, user behavior, and content patterns through clustering techniques.

Key components of this project include exploratory data analysis (EDA), the application of clustering algorithms, and the development of a user-friendly dashboard to visualize the results. The tech stack comprises Python for the core programming, Dash for both frontend and backend development, and scikit-learn for the clustering algorithms.

To utilize this dashboard, clone the repository and run the Python-based Dash application.
