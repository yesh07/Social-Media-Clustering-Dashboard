# Social Media Clustering Dashboard

The Clustering with Social Media Data with Dash project showcases expertise in data visualization, clustering, and web development using Python. This project focuses on building an interactive dashboard to cluster and analyze social media data using the Dash framework. The primary goal is to provide a powerful tool for understanding social media trends, user behavior, and content patterns through clustering techniques.

## Introduction

Social media is one of the biggest sources of open-source data. In this project, I explored how to use clustering techniques to help customers identify what is working well—or not so well—in their social media strategies. The project demonstrates the use of clustering algorithms, with the results visualized in a standalone Plotly dashboard.

## Project Overview

The project follows a typical unsupervised learning workflow:

- **Importing Unsupervised Data**: Loading social media data for clustering.
- **Split Data into Training and Testing**: Dividing the data to evaluate model performance.
- **EDA for Unsupervised Tasks**: Analyzing the data to understand patterns and relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing for Clustering**: Preparing the data, including feature scaling and encoding.
- **Modelling with KMeans**: Applying the KMeans algorithm to cluster the data.
- **Evaluating Performance**: Assessing the clustering results and their validity.
- **Building a Standalone Plotly Dashboard**: Creating an interactive dashboard to visualize the clusters and insights.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Dash
- Plotly
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Project Workflow

1. **Importing Unsupervised Data**  
   The first step involves importing social media data that will be used for clustering. This data is the foundation for the entire project.

2. **Split Data into Training and Testing**  
   The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the clustering model on unseen data.

3. **EDA for Unsupervised Tasks**  
   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the structure and distribution of the data, which is crucial for effective clustering.

4. **Data Preprocessing for Clustering**  
   Data preprocessing includes tasks such as feature scaling, encoding, and other techniques to prepare the data for clustering.

5. **Modelling with KMeans**  
   The KMeans algorithm is applied to cluster the social media data into distinct groups, revealing underlying patterns.

6. **Evaluating Performance**  
   The performance of the clustering model is evaluated using metrics appropriate for unsupervised learning, ensuring that the clusters are meaningful and actionable.

7. **Building a Standalone Plotly Dashboard**  
   Finally, a Plotly-based dashboard is created using Dash. This interactive dashboard allows users to visualize the clustering results and derive insights from the data.
